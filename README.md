# Project Caeliai

A research initiative dedicated to establishing new frameworks for fashion intelligence.

Our work involves a series of public studies, called the "Caeliai Genesis" series, where we benchmark and analyze foundational AI capabilities for the fashion domain. Each study is published openly with its methodology, data, and findings.
